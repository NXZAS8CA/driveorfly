# driveorfly
The idea behind this repository is to make it possible for people to check weather they should drive or fly to their destination.

# functionality
it calculates for both options the co2 emissions based on co2 emission per 100km and driven/flight-km. Then it tries to suggest the better solution, if both are equally, it tries to determine the time consumption and price of both and decide on one option.

# privacy
currently no data is stored. In version two however there will be an status section and for this the saved co2 emissions are stored(without any userdata).

# disclaimer
This Repo is currently under construction
